        <h3>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
        <p>The fullform of DOM is Document Object Model which basically an interfaces that represent the reading
            proccedure in which the HTML file will read by browser. The DOM prepare the HTML file as a tree like
            structure and read and manipulate more presicely and efficiently. Each leaf of the called node and that's
            how DOM manipulate the entire HTML file.<br> The DOM elements are used to update the data without reloading
            the web-page. It also give the flexibility to change the layout or contents by user without reloading the
            page. Which help to create more interactive and dynamic web page and increase user satisfaction.</p>

        <h3>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods?</h3>
        <p>Using DOM, we can select any HTML elements via it's class name, id name tag name and also using query
            selector.
            DOM prepare the entire HTML like a document and all the leaf's are treated as node. We can identify those
            node
            or HTML elements via their spesific field name.<br> There are mostly 5 DOM methods which are listed below:
        <ol>
            <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
            <li>getElementById()</li>
            <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
            <li>querySelector()</li>
            <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>What is event bubble?</h3>
        <p>When an event is contained within another element and both elements have registered a handle to that event, the HTML DOM API uses a technique called "event bubbling" to propagate the event. It is a process that starts with the element that caused the event and then spreads to the items in the hierarchy that contain it. The innermost element in event bubbling is responsible for capturing and managing the event before it is passed on to the outer components.</p>

        <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
        <p>A function is called callback function when that functin is called as a parameter of another function. The first function need to wait until that callback function executed and return its output.<br> We will use callback function when we need a larger computation or larger task's result to accomplish another functional activities, in that case we will use callback function to reduce the complexity and code well organization.</p>
